# End-User Feedback for 3xLOGIC Configuration Studio

As someone configuring a 3xLOGIC system, here are the biggest changes that would make the tool easier to use:

- **Reduce friction on the beta gate.** The single shared password prompt feels like an extra hurdle before I can even start building a design. A simple "remember me" toggle that persists across browsers or an account-based login would make the entry smoother for teammates who need to hop in frequently. Right now the screen just asks for the password without more context or recovery help. 
- **Provide a guided, linear checklist.** The current popover menus for "Configure," "Design," and "Finalize" list a lot of actions, but it's not clear which order to follow or when a step is done. A left-rail wizard or progress tracker that marks off tasks (e.g., add cameras → pick NVR → upload floor plan → export) would reduce guesswork compared to hunting through the dropdowns.
- **Offer starter templates and recommendations.** The workflow starts with raw actions like "Add NVR" or "Add POE Switch." Prebuilt bundles for common site types (small retail, warehouse, school) and compatibility cues would help me add the right mix of devices without needing to know every part number.
- **Make the layout tools more discoverable with in-line guidance.** Uploading a floor plan and launching the camera layout designer are buried in a submenu. A dedicated design pane with a short tooltip/walkthrough (how to place cameras, set coverage angles, etc.) would give confidence that I'm using the visual tools correctly.
- **Strengthen sharing and review outputs.** Export/print options exist, but I'd like a branded PDF or shareable link that combines the bill of materials, visualizer snapshot, and storage calculator results so I can review with stakeholders without jumping between multiple downloads.
- **Surface live validation and totals in the visualizer sidebar.** The sticky visualizer area is great, but I'd like to see running totals (channel counts vs. switch capacity, storage headroom, license usage) and inline warnings when I over-allocate. That would prevent surprises later without requiring a separate calculator run.
